/**
 * Recent activity — a `kind: 'panel'` widget in the **activity** category, and
 * the demo's tabbed card.
 *
 * Registered in `App.tsx` §4. It is the same shape as the host's own *Overall
 * System Health*: a pill strip with a count on each tab, and a feed underneath
 * filtered to the selection. `ui.Tabs` draws the strip — the kit owns that
 * treatment so a contributed card gets the platform's tab styling for free —
 * and the panel below is the app's, which is the split the kit documents: apps
 * differ on whether panels stay mounted, so a `TabPanel` contract would take
 * that choice away.
 *
 * The three inputs a panel is handed, all still on show:
 *
 * - **`widget.range`** — the dashboard's resolved from/to window, because the
 *   registration declares `refreshPolicy: 'shared-range'`. Always timestamps,
 *   never a preset label. The feed is filtered by it, so changing the range
 *   changes every tab's count.
 * - **`widget.pixel`** — the card's real box, measured by the host. Used to
 *   decide how many rows fit. It reported the row-span arithmetic until the
 *   host started measuring, which is why this card used to say "showing 2 of
 *   17" in a card with room for eight.
 * - **`actions`** — `resize()` and `remove()`, driven from the content rather
 *   than only from the frame's menu.
 *
 * `actions.refresh()` is the third action and is not called here: a widget on
 * the shared range has nothing to refresh that the range control does not
 * already drive. The host implements it as a remount; `SyncQueueTable.tsx` is
 * where that earns a button.
