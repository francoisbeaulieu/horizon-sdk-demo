/**
 * Example CRM — a full-page route built from `templates.DashboardTemplate`.
 *
 * The counterpart to everything in `src/widgets/`. Those register into the
 * HOST's dashboards, where they appear in Customize and the user decides
 * whether and where they land. This page is the other model: the app owns the
 * whole surface, declares which cards appear and in what order, and no reader
 * rearranges it. A vendor dashboard for a vendor's feature set.
 *
 * What the template still gives is everything that makes it look like ours —
 * the dashboard page header, the widget grid and its edge-to-edge bleed, and the
 * same card frame a registered widget gets, so each card draws its title,
 * subtitle, shared-range chip and metric tooltip from what is declared here.
 * What it drops is Reorder, Customize and the saved layout, none of which mean
 * anything when the app decided the layout.
 *
 * `rangeControl` opts into the host's own pre-canned window selector. Cards
 * declaring `refreshPolicy: 'shared-range'` then receive resolved timestamps and
 * a window chip in their header; the sync queue declares `'own-cadence'` and is
 * correctly left alone by it.
 *
 * The widgets are the SAME components registered in `App.tsx` §4, reused
 * unchanged through one adapter — see `asPageWidget`. That is the point worth
 * making to a partner: a widget is a component, and where it renders is a
 * registration decision, not something to rebuild for.

/**
 * Run a dashboard widget on a template page.
 *
 * A registered widget is handed `{ context, widget, actions }` by the host. On a
 * page the app is already inside `FlowContextProvider`, so the context comes
 * from `useFlowContext()` instead — the same `ui`, live with the colour mode.
 *
 * `actions` are no-ops, and honestly so: remove, resize and refresh act on a
 * grid the reader arranged, and there is no such grid here. A widget that calls
 * one gets nothing rather than a broken frame.
 *
 * The cast is the seam between two context shapes. `FlowContext` is the
 * page-level object and `ExtensionContext` the injected one; they overlap on
 * everything a widget reads (`ui`, `theme`, `eventBus`, `t`), which is why one
 * component can serve both surfaces at all.
