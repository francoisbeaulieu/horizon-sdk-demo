# Mock fixtures

Static demo data — **not** real data and not fetched from any API. These modules
keep sample content out of the page/component files so those stay focused on UI.

| File                | Used by                                                         | What it is                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `people.ts`         | `crm.ts`                                                        | Shared internal directory (extension → name/department). Single source of truth so the same person reads consistently across surfaces. |
| `crm.ts`            | `services/callEnrichment.ts`, `pages/CrmIntegrationPage`        | CRM records (external callers + internal people), plus `normalizePhoneNumber` / `lookupCrmRecord`.                                     |
| `recentCalls.ts`    | `pages/CrmIntegrationPage.tsx`                                  | Sample recent calls keyed to the CRM directory, shown alongside the user's live calls. Includes `formatDuration`.                      |
| `datagridSample.ts` | `pages/showcase/sections/DataGridSection.tsx`                   | Sample users for the DatagridTemplate example.                                                                                         |
| `callRecordings.ts` | `pages/CallRecordingsPage.tsx`, `widgets/RecordedCallsStat.tsx` | 42 recordings generated deterministically from an index, on **fixed** dates so sorting is stable under test.                           |
| `widgetActivity.ts` | `widgets/RecentActivityWidget.tsx`                              | Call activity built **relative to a caller-supplied `now`** — see below.                                                               |

> **Why one fixture is relative and the rest are fixed.** `callRecordings.ts`
> pins its dates so a table's default sort never shifts under a test run.
> `widgetActivity.ts` cannot: the Recent Activity widget filters it by
> `widget.range`, the live from/to window a dashboard resolves for its widgets,
> and a fixture pinned to a past month falls outside every preset the range
> control offers — the widget would read as broken rather than as filtered. It
> takes `now` as a parameter rather than reading the clock, so a render stays a
> pure function of its inputs.

> The only **live** data in the demo is the CRM Integration page's call to
> `GET /domains/{domain}/users/{user}/cdrs` via `flowContext.api`.
